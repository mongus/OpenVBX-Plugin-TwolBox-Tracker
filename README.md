# TwolBox Tracker OpenVBX Plugin

Feed your Twilio tracking data into Google Analytics via [TwolBox][1].

[1]: http://www.twolbox.com

## Installation

[Download][2] the plugin and extract into /plugins

[2]: https://github.com/mongus/OpenVBX-Plugin-TwolBox-Tracker/archives/master

## Configuration

Go to Settings -> Plugins -> TwolBox Tracker -> Configure

Enter your TwolBox Auth ID and Auth Token.

Enter your Google Analytics Profile ID. You should probably create a new website profile using the "Add a Profile for a new domain" option so you don't get your call tracking mixed in with your website tracking.

## Usage

Now you can drag and drop the applet into your flows. If you don't want the ugly OpenVBX URLs showing up in Google Analytics you can set the path that is reported via an option in the applet.
